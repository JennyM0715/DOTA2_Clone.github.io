# Summary
A static page of DOTA 2 home page on their official website. This was for educational purposes only. I decided the attempt to re-create a static clone page of DOTA2 because it is a computer game that I play sometimes when I have free time. Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Valve. It can be downloaded on Steam and is similar to League of Legends. 

Making this clone page, I leanred about creating carousel slides like the Netflix carousels. However, instead of having left and right arrows at the ends, I used CSS properties like transitions, transform, and animation to make the slides move automatically to left or right direction. Also, used other CSS properties to make the contents of a slide pop-up when you hover the slide which is a feature similar to Netflix. HTML and CSS were used for this static page. Another chanllenge was making the main header that has the video background playing, the big block that has the quote, and the blog cards that displays the written content when user hovers over it.
